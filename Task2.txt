Deep copy - Deep copy is a process in which the copying process occurs 
	recursively. It means first constructing a new collection object and 
	then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found 
	in the original. 

	A deep copy of an object will recursively clone child objects. 
	The clone is fully independent of the original, but creating a deep copy is slower


	


Shallow copy - A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating 
		it with references to the child objects found in the original. The copying 
		process does not recurse and therefore won’t create copies of the child objects 
		themselves. 	
		Making a shallow copy of an object won’t clone child objects. Therefore, 
		the copy is not fully independent of the original.
